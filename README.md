# Mega Mall

This application was created using Flutter with state management bloc, SQLite as a local database and open source API Product as the source of the product list, as well as implementing a clean architecture.

Some features in this application may not have been fully completed, such as authentication features, checkout, etc. However, I think some of the features that are available are <b>```sufficient or in accordance```</b> with the instructions given.
